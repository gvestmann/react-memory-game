# REACT TO MEMORY
## Memory game built with React

For this assignment I decided to embrace my inner child and build a classic memory game with React. I couldn't have it TOO child-friendly, so I used some raunchy illustrations from my friend. It's made nicely responsive by yours truly. I built it locally and deployed to GitHub Pages.

You'll find plenty of code-comments in my components. You'd probably be most interested in these:

* [App.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/react-memory-game/blob/main/src/components/App.js)
* [Card.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/react-memory-game/blob/main/src/components/Card.js)
* [DealCards.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/react-memory-game/blob/main/src/components/DealCards.js)
* [CardBoard.js](https://github.com/gvestmann/react-memory-game/blob/main/src/components/CardBoard.js)
